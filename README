Hiphopathy 

HipHopathy, A Socio-Curricular Study of Introductory Computer Science centered around data science using rap lyrics.

Welcome to an innovative way of teaching and sharing the delights that comes when data, computational methods and culture collide. The goal of this work is to connect cultural relevance to computing by introducing elementary techniques of natural language processing with a corpus of hip-hop data.

Art is something that we often believe that is separate from the so-called hard sciences. As a result, those of people who are gifted in the arts or are inclined in that direction, shy away from the sciences because many fall prey to the false choice of choosing between the arts or the sciences.

I want to change this false dichotomy by bringing the power of computational methods to investigate and explore the riches that are inherent in the arts. It is for this reason that I have chosen to use a corpus of hip-hop lyrics as the dataset on which we will practice our computational techniques. At the end of this series of exercises you will be able to build a visualization of the occurrence of certain words in a rap corpus.
