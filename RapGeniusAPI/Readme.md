## Install

This project requires Python 2.7 

In addition, you will need to be able to run an iPython Notebook to complete this project.

## Code

Template code is provided in the `RapGeniusAPI.ipynb` notebook file. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested throughout the notebook.

## Run

In a terminal/command window, go to the top-level project directory `RapGeniusAPI/` (that contains this README). Then run:

```ipython notebook RapGeniusAPI.ipynb```
