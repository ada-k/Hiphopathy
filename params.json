The goal of this work is to connect cultural relevance to computing by introducing elementary techniques of natural language processing with a corpus of hip-hop data.\r\n\r\nArt is something that we often believe is separate from the so-called hard sciences. As a result, people who are gifted in the arts or are inclined in that direction, shy away from the sciences because of the perceived false choice of choosing between the arts or the sciences.\r\n\r\nI want to change this false dichotomy by bringing the power of computational methods to investigate and explore the riches that are inherent in the arts. It is for this reason that I have chosen to use a corpus of hip-hop lyrics as the dataset on which we will practice our computational techniques. At the end of this series of exercises you will be able to build a visualization of the occurrence of certain words in a rap corpus.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n[Chapter 1: Snap to Python]\r\n(http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/omoju/hiphopathy/blob/master/SnaptoPython/SnaptoPython.ipynb)\r\n\r\n[Chapter 2: Lyrics Exploration](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/omoju/hiphopathy/blob/master/HipHopDataExploration/HipHopDataExploration.ipynb)\r\n\r\n[Chapter 3: Lets play with some APIs](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/omoju/hiphopathy/blob/master/RapGeniusAPI/RapGeniusAPI.ipynb)\r\n\r\n## Publication\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n| Title    | HipHopathy, A Socio-Curricular Study of Introductory Computer Science |\r\n| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Author   | Omoju Miller \t\t\t\t\t\t\t                               |\r\n| Advisor  | [Dr. Alice Agogino][Alice] \t\t\t\t\t                       |\r\n| Degree   | Doctor of Philosophy, Computer Science Education \t                   |\r\n| Date     | Dec 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                               |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[Alice]: http://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/alice-m-agogino\r\n\r\n- [Its Deeper than Rap: Toward Culturally Responsive CS](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2604994). *XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students, 20(4), 28-30.*\r\n- [Snap!(build your own blocks)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2539022). *In Proceedings of the 45th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education (pp. 749-749).
